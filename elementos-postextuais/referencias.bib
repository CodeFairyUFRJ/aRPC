	abstract = {Microservices architecture frameworks have been developed by the community of software engineers to solve some of the problems supporting the client-server model. G Remote Procedure Calls (GRPC) is a microservice framework which uses the new HyperText Transfer Protocol version 2 (HTTP2) to support many different clients such as desktops, browsers, mobile devices, etc., and handle communications between them and the servers in an efficient manner. GRPC gives opportunity to use protobuffers which offer maintainability and scalability features by defining services and messages. The protofiles can then be transpiled from the proto language to the specific programming language implementation of the applications. One of the benefits gained in using protobuffers is the client applications are able to find errors within its source code in compile instead of runtime, raising its stability factor. In addition, GRPC offers many different channels of communication between the server and clients, such as Simple RPC, Server-side Streaming RPC, Client-Side Streaming RPC, and Bidirectional RPC, and each have their purpose to solve specific use cases. We demonstrate each channel in a fictitious forum application to help explain their functionality. GRPC also offers error handling between the channels to ensure clients can follow a standard. In addition, GRPC also offer the capability to pass authentication information between client and server within the message. We look at GRPC as a microservice framework to help support the multitude of client applications written in many different programming languages and still maintain a stable line of communication with the server.},

We try to bring the process group concept into RPC systems and present a new kind of communication cooperation mechanism supporting the cooperation among distributed entities in distributed systems. We call it GRPC(Group Remote Procedure Call) mechanism. According to different application background, the related GRPC mechanism are named lookup, function-convergence and update GRPC. The prototype systems of these three specific classes of GRPC mechanisms have been implemented in the local area network which consists of SUN 4 workstations. The performance evaluation on these prototype systems has been made. Practice has shown: the GRPC mechanism can not only improve the parallelism, reliability and transparency of RPC systems, but also enable RPC systems to support group communication.},

	abstract = {Interactive applications, such as search, social networking and retail, hosted in cloud data center generate large quantities of small workloads that require extremely low median and tail latency in order to provide soft real-time performance to users. These small workloads are known as short TCP flows. However, these short TCP flows experience long latencies due in part to large workloads consuming most available buffer in the switches. Imperfect routing algorithm such as ECMP makes the matter even worse. We propose a transport mechanism using replication for predictability to achieve low flow completion time (FCT) for short TCP flows. We implement replication for predictability within Apache Thrift transport layer that replicates each short TCP flow and sends out identical packets for both flows, then utilizes the first flow that finishes the transfer. Our results show that by using replication for predictability for short TCP flows, we can reduce median FCT by 15\% and tail FCT by 20\%. When integrated with Cassandra, we can also improve the performance of Read operation with flow replication.},

Such systems need to communicate in a struc-tured form in a way that uses standardized technologies for better results. Mobile systems also have a number of limited features like battery life, internal storage and processing performance. Such restrictions can be mitigated by the use of computational offloading since algorithms or applications can be executed in the cloud or other networked devices. This article is intended for the analysis of emerging technologies in cross-process communication between Linux and Android-based multiplatforms using the gRPC framework. Applications have been developed in various object-oriented programming languages for performing remote procedure calls between a single-board computer and a personal-use smartphone for processing higher order arrays and applying filters to images. Then, a series of analyzes were performed on the transferred data and the computational offloading performance of the algorithms in each platform.},

	abstract = {There has been a high concern regarding the energy saving on mobile devices recently, for mobile devices have been performing increasingly complex tasks over time. The computation offloading is one of the most popular techniques used by developers as an effective way of saving energy on mobile devices, which consists on executing complex tasks in external servers with different purposes including save energy. Deciding towards offloading certain tasks requires to understand the influence of the amount of data, amount of computation, and the network profile. Several studies have investigated the influence of different wireless flavours, such as 3G, 4G and wifi, but no study has investigated the influence of the communication choices on the energy cost. Therefore, in this paper, we present an experiment we conducted to evaluate the energy consumption of different communication protocols and architectural styles, namely REST, SOAP, Socket and gRPC, when executing algorithms of different complexities and different input sizes and types. Results show that local execution is more economic with less complex algorithms and small input data. When it comes to remote execution, REST is the most economic choice followed by Socket. Moreover, our data show that computation offloading can save up to 10 time as much energy when compared to local execution for some executions configurations.},

	abstract = {Microservices Architecture is becoming an prominent standard when it comes to designing high-level architecture of complex applications. Each microservice addresses one small part of the application with very specific functionalities for very specific business requirements. With such limited scope, it can be deployed as a standalone service. Different microservices in the same system can be written in different programming languages, depending on the tasks they need to accomplish. Despite its popularity, microservices architecture also has challenging issues and communication between the microservices is one of those. RPC has been universally adopted in large distributed software systems with the client-server model of computing and is suitable for use in microservices architecture. IDT Messaging Oy’s MagicWords system consists of several microservices written in Java and Python and uses MsgPack RPC to facilitate inter-services communication. However, MsgPack is outdated, not widely adopted and hence lacks continuous updates, bug fixes, as well as community support. The goal of this thesis is to investigate which RPC framework I should implement to replace MsgPack. 
 
I choose three popular open-source data serialization and RPC frameworks for my investigation, they are gRPC, Apache Thrift, and Avro. I perform extensive benchmarking tests to evaluate their performance in terms of message serialization and end-to-end communication for both Java and Python implementations. The execution time, CPU usage and memory usage are recorded. I then analyze the performance results as well as the implementation style of each framework. The performance of gRPC even though is not the best in all scenarios, it is in general very good. Furthermore, gRPC has comprehensive documentation, follows modern style, and is still actively developed and therefore the conclusion is to adopt gRPC for MagicWords.},

	abstract = {Today, there are more than 7 billion connected devices including resource-constrained devices which are capable of participating in service collaborations. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is prominent as a result of loose coupling and platform independence, not to mention the business-IT alignment of service-oriented solutions. Also, loose coupling and platform independence match mobile device connection intermittence and platform diversity, respectively. Concerns about implementation arise as a result of the resource constraints of mobile devices. Besides, service composition plays a crucial role in the achievement of business-IT alignment by service-oriented solutions that need to be concerned. The most common implementation of a SOA service is the SOAP web service, which is supported by several service composition standards and tools such as WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, BPML, ebXML, OWL-S and WSMF, but suffers from SOAP verboseness and text serialization/deserialization overheads. SOAP computational and communicational overheads make SOAP inefficient for service collaborations of mobile devices which have resource constraints and experience connection intermittences. In contrast with the SOAP web service, Thrift service is a computationally efficient binary implementation for SOA services. Thrift services benefit greatly from binary serialization/deserialization, they lack sufficient standards and tools for service composition to achieve business-IT alignment. This study proposes an architecture to provide service composition capabilities for thrift services, so that the architecture enables users to either combine Thrift services as a composite Thrift service and to invoke the resultant Thrift services directly from BPEL or to orchestrate Thrift services and SOAP web services together and to invoke the resultant service in the same way. The initial implementation was promising and is discussed in this paper.},

Google proposed the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) protocol, an user level protocol, running on top of UDP, to solve those issues. Google argues that the response time (Page Load Time) is shorter and thus the end-user experience better. First papers evaluated the intrinsic performances of QUIC, but none compared QUIC with the network, the website structure and the involved actors in mind. In this paper, we present the results of our evaluation, performed on a local testbed as well as on Internet, and our analysis to identify in which conditions QUIC is of interest, which actors can benefit from having QUIC deployed in the network and what impacts QUIC can lead to.},

	abstract = {HTTP/2 is the next generation of the HTTP protocol, and as such, it is supposed to solve past issues and to bring improved performances. Through thorough experiments, we try to bring reliable figures on this new version of the protocol. To do this, we adopt a methodological approach, taking newly introduced features into consideration: compression, multiplexing, server push and priority. Previous studies have shown the SPDY protocol to behave worse than HTTP on cellular networks. Similarly, in this paper, we highlight that HTTP/2 is negatively impacted by packet loss which is characteristic of cellular networks. We also experimented on server push and priority to understand their behavior. Because these mechanisms leave a lot of freedom to implementers, they have high potential; and right now they are under-exploited. Overall, we get practical information on how much one can gain by switching their services to HTTP/2.},

We investigate 12 classes of artefacts found in software language processing, present a case study demonstrating their implementations and state-of-the-art mappings among them, and systematically explore the technical research space of bidirectional mappings to build on top of the existing body of work and discover as of yet unused relationships.},
